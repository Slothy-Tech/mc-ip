<h1>Bypass IP Ban in Minecraft</h1>
<p>This guide walks you through a complete method to bypass an IP ban in Minecraft (Java Edition). It’s designed for PC players trying to rejoin multiplayer servers after being kicked or permanently banned based on their IP address. Follow the steps carefully to avoid detection and keep your new identity clean.</p>

<h2>If You Are HWID Banned</h2>
<p>Some Minecraft servers — like Hypixel — are known to issue hardware bans (HWID bans) alongside IP bans, especially after severe offenses or repeated evasion. If new accounts and IPs are still getting auto-banned, you’re likely HWID banned as well and will need to spoof your device identifiers.</p>

<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Minecraft servers can issue IP bans that block your connection to specific multiplayer networks.</li>
    <li>Some bans go further by tracking MAC addresses or Minecraft account UUIDs.</li>
    <li>This guide focuses on bypassing an IP ban using network, software, and system changes to look like a new player.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Method: Mandatory Steps to Bypass IP Bans</h2>
<p>To bypass a Minecraft IP ban, follow these steps in order. Skipping any of them may result in detection or another ban.</p>

<h3>1. Changing Your IP Address</h3>
<p>Your public IP is usually what servers like Hypixel use to block access. You need a new one to appear as a different player.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Using a VPN:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Use a paid VPN service — free VPNs often share IP ranges that are already banned.</li>
            <li>Connect to a fresh server, then check your IP at <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com">whatismyipaddress.com</a> before launching Minecraft.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Switching Networks:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Connect to a different Wi-Fi network or use mobile data through a hotspot to get a fresh IP.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Requesting a new IP from ISP:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Restart your modem or contact your ISP to assign a new dynamic IP if you’re on a static one.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you’re banned within seconds of joining a server with a new IP, you might be HWID flagged — go back to the HWID section.</p>

<h3>2. Clearing Cache and Cookies</h3>
<p>Web logins to Minecraft.net, Mojang, or Microsoft accounts may store cookies that servers or launchers can use to track you.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>For PC:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to your browser settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data.</li>
            <li>Clear cookies, cached content, and saved site data.</li>
            <li>Restart your browser before logging into any new account.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Also avoid logging into your old banned Minecraft account — doing so can relink your IP and fingerprint.</p>

<h3>3. Uninstalling and Reinstalling Minecraft</h3>
<p>To be safe, reinstall Minecraft to wipe any temp files or launcher caches that may store account, mod, or session data.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>For PC:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Uninstall Minecraft from Control Panel or Settings.</li>
            <li>Delete leftover folders:
                <ul>
                    <li><code>%appdata%\.minecraft</code></li>
                    <li><code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Minecraft Launcher</code></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Reboot your PC and download a fresh installer from the official website.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Be cautious with third-party clients or mod launchers (e.g., Lunar, Badlion). These can carry identifiers across bans if not wiped fully.</p>

<h3>4. Changing MAC Address</h3>
<p>Some servers may track your MAC address to block specific hardware. Spoofing your MAC helps you appear as a completely new user.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>For PC:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Control Panel → Network and Sharing Center → Adapter Settings.</li>
            <li>Right-click active adapter → Properties → Configure.</li>
            <li>In the “Advanced” tab, find “Network Address” → enter a new 12-digit value.</li>
            <li>Save and restart your PC.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Use a MAC address generator online to get a safe, unique value.</p>

<h2>How It Works Together</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Hides your banned IP address.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Removes browser links and cached account sessions.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Wipes Minecraft launcher and client traces.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Masks your device from being hardware-flagged again.</li>
</ul>
<p>All four steps combine to reset your identity to Minecraft servers, increasing the odds of staying unbanned.</p>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Always use a clean Minecraft account — do not log into a banned account again.</li>
    <li>Don’t use the same username, skin, or mod configuration from your old account.</li>
    <li>Avoid cheating or exploiting immediately after bypassing — most bans are triggered by behavior patterns.</li>
    <li>If using Forge or Fabric, clean out mod folders or use a fresh installation.</li>
    <li>Test your new setup on a smaller server before trying to rejoin big ones like Hypixel or Mineplex.</li>
</ul>

<p>This method ensures a clean re-entry into Minecraft multiplayer. Be smart, stay low-key, and avoid old habits that got you banned in the first place.</p>
